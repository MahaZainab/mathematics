# Day 1: Vectors

## Introduction to Vectors
Vectors are essential to understanding linear algebra and have multiple interpretations across various disciplines:
- **Physics Perspective:** Vectors are arrows in space with defined length and direction.
- **Computer Science Perspective:** Vectors are ordered lists of numbers, such as [square footage, price] in housing data.
- **Mathematician's Perspective:** Vectors are abstract entities that support operations like addition and scalar multiplication.

## Geometric Interpretation
Vectors in linear algebra are often visualized as arrows originating from the zero point in a coordinate system:
- **2D Vectors:** Described by coordinates that dictate movement along the x and y axes.
- **3D Vectors:** Include an additional z-axis for three-dimensional space representation.

## Vector Operations
### Vector Addition
- Combine two vectors by aligning the tail of the second vector to the tip of the first; the resulting vector spans from the first vector's tail to the second's tip.
- Example: `[3, 3] + [2, -1]` results in `[5, 2]`.

### Scalar Multiplication
- Multiply each component of a vector by a scalar to stretch, squish, or reverse its direction.
- Example: `2 * [1, 2]` results in `[2, 4]`.

## Importance of Vector Operations
Vector operations are pivotal in linear algebra, facilitating an understanding of key concepts such as span, bases, and linear dependence.

## Dual Perspectives
Vectors are dual in nature:
- **Geometric Objects:** Visualized as arrows.
- **Algebraic Objects:** Represented as lists of numbers.
The ability to switch between these perspectives enhances problem-solving in linear algebra.

## Applications
- **Data Analysis:** Vectors assist in visualizing and conceptualizing data patterns.
- **Physics and Computer Graphics:** Vectors numerically describe space and transformations.
- **Animations:** Employed in computational representation of spatial movements.

## Key Takeaways
- Vectors are interpreted both geometrically and algebraically.
- Core operations include vector addition and scalar multiplication.
- The interplay between geometric intuition and algebraic computation is crucial.
- Linear algebra's applications span across multiple fields including data science, physics, and computer graphics.
